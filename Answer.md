The impact of social media on mental health is a complex issue characterized by both negative and positive findings:

1. **Negative Impacts**: Research indicates that social media can negatively affect overall well-being, contributing to anxiety, depression, loneliness, and feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out) (Health UC Davis, 2024) [1, 1].

2. **Association with Poor Mental Health**: Higher levels of social media usage have been correlated with poorer mental health outcomes. However, this relationship is considered small and may be influenced by preexisting conditions in users (PMC NCBI, 2023) [2, 1].

3. **Complex Effects**: While social media has the potential to enhance social connections, increase self-esteem, and improve the sense of belonging, it can also lead to anxiety and depressive symptoms (BMC Psychology, 2023) [3, 1].

4. **Increased Risk Factors**: Systematic reviews have shown that social networking site usage is linked to an elevated risk of psychological issues, including depression and anxiety, highlighting the potential for distress (Stanford Law, 2024) [4, 1].

5. **Link to Mental Health Issues**: Numerous studies support a strong connection between heavy social media usage and an increased risk of emotional problems, such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and even suicidal thoughts (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2023) [5, 1].

6. **Additional Findings**: Further research corroborates that social media can contribute to poor sleep and cognitive issues, while also suggesting a rise in problematic social media behavior among adolescents (Pew Research, 2025; WHO, 2024) [6, 1].

In conclusion, the body of literature indicates that although social media can foster a sense of community and belonging, it is also associated with a range of negative mental health outcomes, necessitating cautious and mindful use. The dual nature of social media's impact means that its effects on mental health are significant and warrant further exploration and understanding.
