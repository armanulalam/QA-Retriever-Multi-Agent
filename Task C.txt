Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that defines how AI interact with external tools or data sources.It is a like a port where by the help of USB port we can connect with various peripherals.Basically, MCP is a communication bridge between AI models and external systems(APIs,databases etc).MCP allows AI models to access dynamic data securely,
maintain consistent context management. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with multiple tools or environments.

To build a MCP server:
Firstly, I will create the virtual environment and install the MCP SDK and other necessary libraries.Secondly,I will write the server code to create the server file,instantiate the server,define tools with functions and add resource functions.Then,I will run and test my server locally.Finally, I will deploy it in cloud like AWS.

Pseudocode:

initialize MCP_Server:
    setup communication channel (WebSocket / HTTP)
    register available tools or APIs

on receive(request):
    validate request format
    extract command and parameters

    if request.type == "query_database":
        result = query_database(request.params)
    elif request.type == "fetch_document":
        result = read_document(request.params)
    elif request.type == "run_agent":
        result = invoke_agent(request.params)
    else:
        result = {"error": "Invalid request type"}

    create MCP_response:
        {
            "status": "success",
            "data": result,
            "metadata": { "timestamp": current_time }
        }

    send MCP_response back to client

loop forever:
    wait for next request
